# BattleCoin Test Package

This package contains a minimal frontend (Vite + React) and backend (Express + Mongoose) for the BattleCoin MVP test.

Instructions:
1. Upload frontend and backend folders to your GitHub repo.
2. On Render, create a Web Service (backend) with Root Directory `backend` and a Static Site (frontend) with Root Directory `frontend`.
3. Set environment variable MONGODB_URI on Render for the backend.

Frontend runs with Vite; backend runs with node src/index.js
